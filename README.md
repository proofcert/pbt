## Prerequisites

The development, written in the Î»Prolog programming language, via
[Teyjus](https://github.com/teyjus/teyjus/), goes with the submitted paper "Property-Based Testing by Elaborating Proof Outlines"

## Repository structure

To be much improved and factored ASAP. Right now, it mirrors with
many, many repetitions the code mentioned in the paper

- sect5/ dir with code for random generation and subsuming sect 4.
- sect6.*  Single mod file for the Church Rosser case study
- sect7.*  Single mod file for testing via linear logic

- one/ working dir for all the above w/o repetitions, but slightly different
from paper, namely using llinterp/llcheck by default

## Running the tests
